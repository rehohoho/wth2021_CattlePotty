## CattlePotty
Solution that enhances and incentivizes the collection of cow urine
  - Reduce pollution: nitrate oxides are 300x more damaging than CO2, nitrates leach and pollutes water bodies
  
## Changing cow behaviour
Positive reinforcement by feeding cow when they pee at the selected pasture, where the collection system is built.
- Wearable strap with UID, communicates through BLE. 
- Smart feeder, triggers using BLE.
- Paired sensors, detects if cow is urinating

We check that:
  1) Cow is urinating (paired sensor)
  2) At the right place (BLE connection)
